# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Iris Dataset 🌸

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the classic **Iris dataset** using Python.  
The Iris dataset is one of the most well-known datasets in machine learning and statistics, consisting of 150 samples of iris flowers with four features:

- 🌱 **Sepal Length**  
- 🌱 **Sepal Width**  
- 🌸 **Petal Length**  
- 🌸 **Petal Width**  

and a target variable:  
- 🌼 **Species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)**

---

## 🔍 Project Overview
The notebook covers:
- Importing and understanding the dataset  
- Cleaning and preprocessing (if required)  
- Descriptive statistics and data summary  
- Data visualization using **Matplotlib & Seaborn**  
- Insights into feature distributions and relationships  
- Correlation analysis between variables  
- Species-wise comparisons  

---

## 📊 Key Visualizations
- Histograms & KDE plots of features  
- Pair plots showing relationships between features  
- Box plots for species comparison  
- Heatmaps for correlation  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**  
- **NumPy**  
- **Pandas**  
- **Matplotlib**  
- **Seaborn**  

---

## 📌 Insights
- Setosa species shows clear separation from the others based on petal features.  
- Versicolor and Virginica overlap but can be distinguished using petal length & width.  
- Sepal features are less discriminative compared to petal features.
